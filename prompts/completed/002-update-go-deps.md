<summary>
- Update all Go module dependencies to latest versions using the `updater` tool
- Run `updater go` from the repo root
- Verify `make precommit` passes after the update
</summary>

<objective>
Keep go.mod dependencies current by running the standard updater flow.
</objective>

<context>
Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
Read docs/dod.md for the Definition of Done.
The `updater` CLI is installed in the container (via uv). It bumps Go deps, runs tests, and updates CHANGELOG.
</context>

<requirements>
1. Run `updater go` from `/workspace`
2. If `updater go` completes cleanly, run `make precommit` to confirm green state
3. Resolve any new failures surfaced by the update (test breakage from new dep versions)
</requirements>

<constraints>
- Do NOT commit — dark-factory handles git
- Do NOT add features or refactor — this is a dependency-only update
- If a dep bump introduces a hard incompatibility, leave go.mod at the last green version and document the blocker in the summary
</constraints>

Run `make precommit` — exit 0.
